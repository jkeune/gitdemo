# gitdemo

This is the README for the gitdemo. 

## usage
There are two scripts in here. Just play around with them!
Use
```
./conversation.sh
```
to start a silly conversation about git...
Or decrypt any 'text' to SHA1 with
```
./convert2sha1.sh <text>
```
Or play around with the oracle... 
```
python oracle.py
```
