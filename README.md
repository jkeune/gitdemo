# gitdemo: a short introduction to git and github

This repository contains a short introduction and hands-on for git and github. It was held in October 2019 at the Hydro-Climate Extremes Lab at Ghent University. 

### Content
The repository contains: 
- `gitintro_lhwm.pdf`: presentation
- `fancylog.txt`: a fancy git log style 
- `conversation.sh` (sample script)
- `convert2sha1.sh` (sample script)
- `oracle.py` (sample script)
- `README.md` (this README)

The google presentation of the pdf-version is available at:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dWV4lVvhwhjb5ZBcQsRaTt_j5kFX9qwQtK1464QPnLE/edit?usp=sharing

### Usage
There are a few sample scripts in here. Just play around with them!

Use
```
./conversation.sh
```
to start a silly conversation about git...

Or decrypt any 'text' to SHA1 with
```
./convert2sha1.sh <text>
```

Or play around with the oracle... 
```
python oracle.py
```

### Additional tasks
1. Checkout the issues, pick one, assign yourself and start coding!
2. If you're done, push your changes to this github repository and make a pull request into another branch. 
3. Assign someone else to review your changes... and see your branch being merged into the other branch!

* Feel free to add more nonsense...
