# gitdemo

This is the README for the gitdemo. 

## usage
There are two scripts in here. Just play around with them!

Use
```
./conversation.sh
```
to start a silly conversation about git...

Or decrypt any 'text' to SHA1 with
```
./convert2sha1.sh <text>
```

Or play around with the oracle... 
```
python oracle.py
```

## TO DO's
1. Checkout the issues, pick one, assign yourself and start coding!
2. If you're done, push your changes to this github repository and make a pull request into another branch. 
3. Assign someone else to review your changes... and see your branch being merged into the other branch!

* Feel free to add more nonsense...
